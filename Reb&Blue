Intro (talk from the perspective of the frisbee)

Schhhhup. After catching the upward ventialiation from a street mana exhaust, a bight green and red child's flying disc spins rapidly in the air.
Just inches from slicing into the sun. Green and red start tilting down towards the earth to initiatie a swan dive into anticipatig small hands.
Diving fast and faster the disc comes just short of the ground before three hands come to grab the prized points. A quick hand comes and grabs the disc for 100 made up points.

A sneaky 2nd place player jabs "50 points!"
Blue accuses "You said 100 points."
3rd place verifies "he said 100 points I heard it!"

As 2nd place grabs the disc to complete his turn of throws, he warms up his wrist and rotates his hips as if to show that he is all business now.
Red forcefully states "300 points dead or alive." and with that statement he throws a downward curve on the disc to take the mana exhaust plume higher in the air then usual.
Unfortunately, a gust of wind takes the disc just outside of the groups' play area. Red gives up at the thought of asking Blue's parents for permission.
Red Shrugs "Well at least it no one got it"
Blue looks at Red for the millionth time "You said dead or alive"
Red retorts matter of factly "I said de not dead"
Blue returns with "You said dead"
R "No I didn't"
B "Yes you did"
R "This went out of bounds"
B "So, it's still dead or alive"
R "No it's out of bounds, dead or alive doesn't count when it's out of bounds"
B "So you admit you said dead or alive"
R "No. prove I said that"
B "Jimmy? Where's Jimmy?"
