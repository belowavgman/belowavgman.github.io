Intro (talk from the perspective of the frisbee)

Schhhhup. After catching the upward ventialiation from a street mana exhaust, a bight green and red child's flying disc spins rapidly in the air.
Just inches from slicing into the sun. Green and red start tilting down towards the earth to initiatie a swan dive into anticipatig small hands.
Diving fast and faster the disc comes just short of the ground before three hands come to grab the prized points. A quick hand comes and grabs the disc for 100 made up points.
